SOLRAI – Investor Summary and Project README
Vision

SOLRAI transforms renewable energy production into instant, auditable, blockchain-native energy credits.
Built on the XRP Ledger (XRPL), SOLRAI enables solar farms, utilities, and system owners to convert each kilowatt-hour (kWh) of verified generation into a token, and every megawatt-hour (MWh) into a serialized SOLRAI NFT credit—ready to sell directly to corporate buyers.

The Problem

Slow & costly crediting: Today’s SREC/REC issuance is slow, fragmented, and often centralized, creating delays and fees for producers.

Opaque markets: Corporates demand trustworthy credits to meet ESG commitments, but struggle to verify provenance and compliance.

Under-monetized producers: Solar farms and distributed systems often receive less than fair value for their output due to middlemen and inefficient registries.

The SOLRAI Solution

STN/SOLR Tokens – 1 token = 1 kWh measured. Minted directly from smart-meter data via oracles.

Burn-to-Mint Model – Retire 1,000 SOLR → mint a SOLRAI NFT = 1 MWh, carrying jurisdiction, facility ID, vintage, and meter hash.

Direct Corporate Access – NFTs can be listed on-ledger and purchased instantly in RLUSD or XRP via Xaman/Xumm, creating a liquid marketplace for energy credits.

Compliance-First – Controlled issuance, RequireAuth trustlines, embedded metadata, and legal alignment with REC/SREC structures.

Market Opportunity

The global REC market exceeds $14 billion, growing double digits annually.

U.S. states like New Jersey price SRECs at $85–$300/MWh.

Emerging markets in Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, and Latin America are seeking faster, cheaper credit frameworks.

SOLRAI is positioned to become the bridge between renewable producers and ESG-driven corporate buyers, with the XRP Ledger delivering speed, low cost, and carbon neutrality.

Business Model

Minting fees: 1–3% per NFT issued.

Marketplace fees: Small % per trade on XRPL.

Enterprise partnerships: White-label solutions for solar farms, utilities, and corporates.

Why XRPL, Why Us

XRPL-native: Fast, cheap, energy-efficient ledger with live NFT and AMM standards.

Wallet-first UX: One-click onboarding via Xumm/Xaman.

Experienced team: NABCEP-certified solar professionals and blockchain architects with deep ties to PR/DR energy transition.
