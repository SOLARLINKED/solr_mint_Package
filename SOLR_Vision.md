INVESTOR VISION — SOLR/SOLRAI
=========================

Problem Statement
-----------------
The electric grid is transitioning to distributed renewable generation. Small and medium solar owners often cannot directly monetize the environmental attributes (SRECs) of their generation efficiently, transparently, and with low fees. Current SREC markets are fragmented, paper-heavy, and often slow — creating friction for owners and uncertainty for buyers.

Opportunity
-----------
Tokenizing Proof-of-Generation (PoG) unlocks immediate liquidity for verified renewable generation, lowers transaction friction, and creates verifiable on-chain certificates (SOLRAI NFTs) that are easier to audit, retire, and transfer. The XRPL provides low-fee, fast settlement and native token support.

Impact
------
- Energy independence and local resilience: easier monetization of local generation.
- Faster marketplace settlement and lower fees than traditional registries.
- Better audit trails for regulators and buyers through on-chain metadata and burn proofs.

Why now
-------
- Falling costs of solar, faster metering and oracles, and wallet-first UX (Xumm/Xaman) align to make a compliant tokenized SREC product feasible today.
