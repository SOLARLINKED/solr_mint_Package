your limited access to and use of the software, source code, documentation,
and other materials owned by SOLR Energy & Technology, LLC ("Licensor"). By
accessing, reviewing, or using the materials provided for the BDAX panel
presentation (the "Materials"), you agree to the terms below.

1. Limited Evaluation License
-----------------------------
Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor grants you a
non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable, limited license to access and
review the Materials solely for the purpose of evaluating the SOLRAI
project during the BDAX panel or for related internal evaluation by the
panel/judges (the "Evaluation Purpose"). This license does not permit
installation, execution beyond demonstration, modification, distribution,
commercial use, creation of derivative works, or any other exploitation of
the Materials.

2. No Right to Copy, Share, or Reuse
-----------------------------------
You may not copy, reproduce, publish, distribute, upload, post, sublicense,
transfer, disclose, or otherwise make the Materials available to any third
party without the prior written consent of Licensor. You must not reverse
engineer, decompile, disassemble, or attempt to extract the source code of
any compiled components. All rights not expressly granted are reserved by
Licensor.

3. Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure
------------------------------------
The Materials shall be treated as confidential and proprietary to Licensor.
You agree to hold the Materials and any derived notes or analysis in strict
confidence and only use them for the Evaluation Purpose. You will protect
the Materials using at least the same degree of care you use to protect
your own confidential information, but no less than reasonable care. You
must not disclose any portion of the Materials, findings, or derivative
works to any third party without Licensor's prior written consent.

4. Return or Destruction
------------------------
Within ten (10) days after the earlier of (a) Licensor's written request
or (b) the conclusion of the Evaluation Purpose, you will, at Licensor's
option, return or destroy all copies of the Materials in your possession or
control and certify in writing to Licensor that you have done so.

5. No Warranty; No Support
-------------------------
The Materials are provided "AS IS" for evaluation purposes only. LICENSOR
DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED

NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR ARISING FROM A COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE.
Licensor is not obligated to provide updates, maintenance, or support for
the Materials under this License.

6. Injunctive Relief and Remedies
--------------------------------
You acknowledge that any breach of this License may cause Licensor
irreparable harm for which monetary damages would be inadequate. Licensor
is therefore entitled to seek injunctive and other equitable relief to
prevent or remedy such breach in addition to any other remedies available
at law or equity.

7. Limitation of Liability
--------------------------
EXCEPT FOR LIABILITY ARISING FROM BREACH OF SECTIONS 2 OR 3 (CONFIDENTIALITY

LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS LICENSE OR THE MATERIALS WILL

SHALL APPLY EVEN IF ANY REMEDY FAILS ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.
